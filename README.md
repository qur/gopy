What is this?
-------------

Idiomatic Python bindings for Google Go

What does that mean?
--------------------

Instead of simply duplicating the Python C API in Go, this is an attempt to
provide the Python API in a form that fits with writing normal Go code.

This means that `PyFoo_XXX(foo, ...)` is `foo.XXX(...)`, and `PyFoo_Check(obj)`
is `foo, ok := obj.(*Foo)` to give a couple of examples.

What versions of Python are supported?
--------------------------------------

Currently, only Python 2.7 is supported.  Though I do hope to add support for
other versions in the future.

Note: Python 2.6 support is currently available on the python2.6 branch.

Docker image
-------------

To provide an low entry point a docker image ([docker-gopy](https://github.com/ChristianKniep/docker-gopy)) is available.
The image ([qnib/gopy](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/qnib/gopy/)) is part of the offizial docker registry, so it can be fetched quite easily.

To run the project's examples, one has to install docker and run the following:

```
$ docker run --rm -ti qnib/gopy /bin/bash
root@10515b87b862:/# su -
root@10515b87b862:~# gopy simple.go 
root@10515b87b862:~# python simple.py 
simple.example: [hello map[123:true]]
root@10515b87b862:~# gopy parallel.go 
root@10515b87b862:~# python parallel.py
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
